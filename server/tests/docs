first run the mongo server for testing
Now, go to mongoose documentation to read find() and remove method
Now, lets see how to test using supertest =>

making request to server and then checking the response that server has sent to client => receiving res in expect
=> if you see server => it is sending the todo doc as response to its client => response = todo doc => check that received doc has text that we sent using expect

Now inside end(), we can just call done() but since we are making request, we can have error too => we will put callback for that inside end()

Though we have tested, but still this is not testing whether server itself has added the doc to mongodb or not => we should test that too => test insdie End() =>

Like said, read model.find() func of mongoose. Now, using this find func inside end(), we are getting all todos inside callback as result => check that therre length is 1 because we just added a todo using post request which we are testiung
Also, test that this one todo in db has text same as text we sent

But, what if db already has some data in it => length won't be 1 => we can run presettings using before

=> in before we have used mongoose remove method to empty the database.

First, we have updated the find() in post by passing the query which  will only give results have text = text we passed
Now we will test our get request => since db should have somethign to get the list of todos => we will add the todos ourself => created array of todos
Now using before, after we have emptied the db, we inserted these tosdos

Now, making a request using supertest for testing the get request
